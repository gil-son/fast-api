# 🚀 FastAPI Python Learning Repository

Welcome to the **FastAPI Python Learning Repository** — a simple, interactive web API that introduces Python concepts using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), a modern web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+.

## 🔧 What Is This?

This repository serves both as a:

- Learning resource for **Python beginners**, and
- Practical example of using **FastAPI** to build and serve content via an API.

It converts static educational content about Python into a dynamic web app using FastAPI.

## 🧠 Why FastAPI?

FastAPI is:
- **Fast**: High-performance, thanks to Starlette and Pydantic.
- **Easy to use**: Minimal boilerplate, great for beginners.
- **Async-ready**: Built on async support for modern Python.
- **Well-documented**: Comes with automatic Swagger docs out of the box.
