Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is easy to learn and widely used in a variety of applications.

What does that mean?

"High-level" means that Python abstracts away a lot of the low-level details of programming, making it more accessible to beginners.

"Interpreted" means that Python code is executed one line at a time, rather than compiled into an executable program. This makes it easier to write and test code because you can see the output of each line immediately, without having to go through the compile and build process.

Python's syntax is also very readable, meaning that the code is written in a way that is easy to understand for humans. This makes it easier to write and maintain code, even as your programs become more complex.

Python is used in a wide range of applications, from web development to scientific computing to artificial intelligence. This means that there are many libraries and frameworks available to developers that can help them write code more efficiently.

Finally, Python has a large and active community of developers who are constantly contributing to the language's development and maintenance of libraries and frameworks. This means that if you have a question or a problem, there is likely someone who has already experienced it and can help you out.
